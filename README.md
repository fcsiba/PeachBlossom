FYP Fall 2018:

Have you ever wanted a little plant to brighten up your desk or home, but you're afraid that you'll forget to water it? Fear no longer! Using an Arduino, a scavenged wall-wart, and a peristaltic pump, you can set up your plant to be watered as often as you like, from a jug or any other vessel. 

# Hardware Requirements
